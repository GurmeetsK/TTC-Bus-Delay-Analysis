To begin with, we want to clean up the data. To do this, we will delete all incidents that have zero delay(as this will not impact this particular analysis).
Moreover, we will delete all vehicle route numbers that do not have a corresponding vehicle route number.
 
DELETE
FROM `toronto bus delay`
WHERE `Min Delay` = 0
 
Note: We will come back to the original data at the end to see how much of an impact removing all these values, and several others, 
will have on the analysis â€“ indicating how much cleaner the original data can be.
 
Next, we want to view how many vehicles, vehicle routes(bus stops), and incident types are operational with the TTC.
 
After a small search, we can see that
 
There are 2400 vehicles in service
There are 192 vehicle routes.
There are 15 incident types
 
Moving on, we can perform short queries on how many vehicles and vehicle routes (bus stops) were impacted by incidents with delays.
 
SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT Vehicle)/2400)*100
FROM `toronto bus delay`;
 
SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT Location)/8554)*100
FROM `toronto bus delay`;
 
We notice a hefty number of vehicles and locations impacted.
 
Next, we want to categorize route types and vehicle types as given by the TTC. For that, we can do a couple of Case Statements as queried below:
 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Route) AS RouteTypes,
CASE
        	WHEN ROUTE BETWEEN 7 AND 189 THEN 'Regular'
	WHEN ROUTE BETWEEN 900 AND 999 THEN 'Express'
	WHEN ROUTE BETWEEN 300 AND 399 THEN 'Night'
	WHEN ROUTE BETWEEN 400 AND 499 THEN 'HubConnectors'
	END AS 'Bus Type Count'
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY `Bus Type Count`

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Vehicle) AS VehicleTypes,
CASE 
	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 1000 AND 1149 THEN 'DIESEL-ELECTRIC'  
	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 1200 AND 1423 THEN 'DIESEL-ELECTRIC'
	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 1500 AND 1689 THEN 'DIESEL-ELECTRIC'
   	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 3100 AND 3369 THEN 'DIESEL'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 3400 AND 3454 THEN 'DIESEL-ELECTRIC'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 3455 AND 3654 THEN 'DIESEL-ELECTRIC'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 3700 AND 3724 THEN 'BATTERY-ELECTRIC'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 3725 AND 3749 THEN 'BATTERY-ELECTRIC'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 3750 AND 3759 THEN 'BATTERY-ELECTRIC'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 7900 AND 7979 THEN 'DIESEL'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 8000 and 8099 then 'DIESEL'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 8100 AND 8219 THEN 'DIESEL'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 8300 AND 8396 THEN 'DIESEL'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 8400 AND 8617 THEN 'DIESEL'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 8620 AND 8964 THEN 'DIESEL'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 9000 AND 9152 THEN 'DIESEL'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 9200 AND 9239 THEN 'DIESEL'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 'W100' AND 'W300' THEN 'DIESEL'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 'W500' AND 'W579' THEN 'GASOLINE'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 'W580' AND 'W627' THEN 'GASOLINE'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 'W628' AND 'W647' THEN 'GASOLINE'
    	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 'W700' AND 'W790' THEN 'GASOLINE'
    	ELSE 'UNDEFINED'
    END AS 'Vehicle Type Count'
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY `Vehicle Type Count`
