To begin with the earnest analytical work, we will start with the total incident counts.
We will use WITH ROLLUP in our query so we can also identify the total number of incidents to compare.
 
SELECT COUNT(Incident), Incident
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY Incident WITH ROLLUP
ORDER BY COUNT(Incident) desc
 
To dive even further, we can query the incident counts per month and day as below. 
This will also include a WITH ROLLUP. We will be able to see total incident counts per month and per day.
 
SELECT COUNT(INCIDENT), month(date), day(date)
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY month(date), day(date) WITH ROLLUP
ORDER BY COUNT(INCIDENT) desc
 
Then, we will do the same by the day of the week.
 
SELECT Day, COUNT(Incident)
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY Day
 
Next, we will query for specific time of incidents in general â€“ which will allow us to visualize how the incidents happen throughout the day.
 
SELECT COUNT(*), time
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY Time
ORDER BY Time asc
 
Lastly, for our general overviews, we will query on incidents per location.
 
SELECT DISTINCT Location, COUNT(Incident)
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY Location
ORDER BY COUNT(Incident) desc
 
Once we have a general overview of the main data points, we can explore how these points interact with each other.
