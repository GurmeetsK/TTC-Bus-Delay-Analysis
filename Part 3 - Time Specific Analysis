We will start with the specifics of which incidents occurred within different time lengths
 
SELECT Incident, COUNT(INCIDENT), month(date)
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY Incident, month(date)
ORDER BY month(date) asc
 
Immediately, we can see that the most incidents all around are Operations or Mechnical related.
 
If we do a similar query for days of the week, we can see a similar result:
 
SELECT Incident, Day, COUNT(Incident)
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY Incident, Day
 
After noticing that Operations and Mechanical are the highest incidents in these queries, we can confirm the same by using OVER in our basic query to see percentages
 
SELECT `Incident`,
COUNT(*),
COUNT(*) * 100 / sum(count(*)) over() as 'percenttotal'
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY Incident
ORDER BY 'percenttotal' desc
 
The bigger issue, of course, would be how much of a delay these incidents cause, so we can do another query to understand which incidents cause most delays:
 
SELECT `Incident`,
sum(`Min Delay`) totaldelay
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY Incident
ORDER BY totaldelay desc
 
We notice that the topmost delay is Diversion. Though there are only around 4.5% of incidents related to diversion, 28% of the minutes delayed are through diversion.
We can confirm that the top 3 most troublesome incidents are Diversion, Operations and Mechanical. Hence, the two queries each below to dive deeper into these 3 incidents.
