To begin with the earnest analytical work, we will start with the total incident counts.
We will use WITH ROLLUP in our query so we can also identify the total number of incidents to compare.
 
SELECT COUNT(Incident), Incident
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY Incident WITH ROLLUP
ORDER BY COUNT(Incident) desc
 
To dive even further, we can query the incident counts per month and day as below. 
This will also include a WITH ROLLUP. We will be able to see total incident counts per month and per day.
 
SELECT COUNT(INCIDENT), month(date), day(date)
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY month(date), day(date) WITH ROLLUP
ORDER BY COUNT(INCIDENT) desc
 
Then, we will do the same by the day of the week.
 
SELECT Day, COUNT(Incident)
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY Day
 
Next, we will query for specific time of incidents in general â€“ which will allow us to visualize how the incidents happen throughout the day.
 
SELECT COUNT(*), time
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY Time
ORDER BY Time asc
 
Next, we will query based on location.

SELECT DISTINCT Location, COUNT(Incident)
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY Location
ORDER BY COUNT(Incident) desc


Finally, we will query Incident Count based on Route and Vehicle type:

SELECT COUNT(Incident),
CASE 
	WHEN ROUTE BETWEEN 7 AND 189 THEN 'Regular'
    WHEN ROUTE BETWEEN 900 AND 999 THEN 'Express'
    WHEN ROUTE BETWEEN 300 AND 399 THEN 'Night'
    WHEN ROUTE BETWEEN 400 AND 499 THEN 'HubConnectors'
    ELSE 'Undefined'
    END AS 'Bus Type'
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY `Bus Type`
ORDER BY COUNT(Incident) desc

SELECT COUNT(Incident),
CASE 
	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 1000 AND 1149 THEN 'DIESEL-ELECTRIC'  
	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 1200 AND 1423 THEN 'DIESEL-ELECTRIC'
	WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 1500 AND 1689 THEN 'DIESEL-ELECTRIC'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 3100 AND 3369 THEN 'DIESEL'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 3400 AND 3454 THEN 'DIESEL-ELECTRIC'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 3455 AND 3654 THEN 'DIESEL-ELECTRIC'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 3700 AND 3724 THEN 'BATTERY-ELECTRIC'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 3725 AND 3749 THEN 'BATTERY-ELECTRIC'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 3750 AND 3759 THEN 'BATTERY-ELECTRIC'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 7900 AND 7979 THEN 'DIESEL'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 8000 and 8099 then 'DIESEL'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 8100 AND 8219 THEN 'DIESEL'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 8300 AND 8396 THEN 'DIESEL'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 8400 AND 8617 THEN 'DIESEL'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 8620 AND 8964 THEN 'DIESEL'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 9000 AND 9152 THEN 'DIESEL'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 9200 AND 9239 THEN 'DIESEL'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 'W100' AND 'W300' THEN 'DIESEL'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 'W500' AND 'W579' THEN 'GASOLINE'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 'W580' AND 'W627' THEN 'GASOLINE'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 'W628' AND 'W647' THEN 'GASOLINE'
    WHEN Vehicle BETWEEN 'W700' AND 'W790' THEN 'GASOLINE'
    ELSE 'UNDEFINED'
    END AS 'Vehicle Type'
FROM `toronto bus delay`
GROUP BY `Vehicle Type`
ORDER BY COUNT(Incident) desc
