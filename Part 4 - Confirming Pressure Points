We will start exploring Mechanical first.

Mechanical:
 
SELECT Location,
COUNT(Incident),
avg(`Min Delay`)
FROM `toronto bus delay`
WHERE Incident = 'Mechanical'
GROUP BY Location
ORDER BY COUNT(Incident) desc
 
SELECT month(date),
COUNT(Incident),
avg(`Min Delay`)
FROM `toronto bus delay`
WHERE Incident = 'Mechanical'
GROUP BY month(date)
ORDER BY COUNT(Incident) desc

 
What we notice first and foremost is that, in the time query, January and June are the highest in count – but the average delay is very similar. 
In the other query, we see Kipling Station and Pioneer Village Station with the highest by quite some margin(above 200 out of more than 2000 locations,
10 of which are above 100).

SELECT month(date), avg(`Min Delay`), count(incident)
FROM `toronto bus delay`
WHERE Location = 'PIONEER VILLAGE STATIO'
AND Incident = 'Mechanical'
GROUP BY month(date)
ORDER BY count(incident) desc
 
SELECT month(date), avg(`Min Delay`), count(incident)
FROM `toronto bus delay`
WHERE Location = 'KIPLING STATION'
AND Incident = 'Mechanical'
GROUP BY month(date)
ORDER BY count(incident) desc

With the above two queries, this pretty much confirms the notion that in terms of Mechanical at least,
January and June were months of note at least for Mechanical.

Next, looking at Operations, we see that Kipling station and Pioneer Village Station are in the top 3 locations, 
with the average delay per month for the Incident on average is one minute higher.
  
SELECT Location,
COUNT(Incident),
avg(`Min Delay`)
FROM `toronto bus delay`
WHERE Incident = 'Operations - Operator'
GROUP BY Location
ORDER BY COUNT(Incident) desc
 
SELECT month(date),
COUNT(Incident),
avg(`Min Delay`)
FROM `toronto bus delay`
WHERE Incident = 'Operations - Operator'
GROUP BY month(date)
ORDER BY COUNT(Incident) desc

 
Next, looking at Operations, we see that Kipling station and Pioneer Village Station are in the top 3 locations, 
with the average delay per month for the Incident on average is one minute higher.
 
Diversion:
 
SELECT Location,
COUNT(Incident),
avg(`Min Delay`)
FROM `toronto bus delay`
WHERE Incident = 'Diversion'
GROUP BY Location
ORDER BY COUNT(Incident) desc
 
SELECT month(date),
COUNT(Incident),
avg(`Min Delay`)
FROM `toronto bus delay`
WHERE Incident = 'Diversion'
GROUP BY month(date)
ORDER BY COUNT(Incident) desc
 
In terms of Diversion, we don’t see Kipling Station specifically have any diversions at all 
But we do notice that in January Diversion count was much higher than the rest, with February and June following close by.
 
In terms of location Bathurst and Roselawn, Bay and Front, Chaplin and Eglinton have 11, 10 and 9 each 
With Exhibition Loop having 6 but with 400 minutes. Moreover, if we modify the query by adding a HAVING clause, 
We can see there are only 15 locations with more than 5 diversions.
 
From all our analysis, we can identify the pressure points as below:
 
Incidents:
Operations,
Mechanical,
Diversion.
 
Locations:
Kipling Station,
Pioneer Village Station
Bathurst and Roselawn(Diversion)
Bay and front(Diversion)
Chaplin and Eglinton(Diversion)
 
Month:
January
June
 
There are of course, natural pressure points throughout the day and week (such as hours before and after work) and Weekdays.
 
Using Tableau(images attached to the Repo) we can see how these specific pressure points interact with the natural pressure points in traffic

With the visualizations we will find out if
These pressure pointsadd to the daily motion of traffic or are they merely a small piece of the congestion puzzle that needs to be solved?
